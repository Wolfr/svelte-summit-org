## Svelte Summit - Spring Edition

### Design briefing

A 3rd Svelte Society virtual conference will be organized in spring.

This time we will organise things a bit better, using Sessionize.

We will hire a professional video editor to piece together the talks. There will be a different briefing for the video editor (see root of this repo).

For Svelte Summit we made a website design in Figma (<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/eGZWK3nGZoOfvTDXzDE5bo/Svelte-Summit?node-id=0%3A1">link</a>)

We will build on the existing assets.

Designs will have to be done for the website + for the slides that can be used by the video editor.
