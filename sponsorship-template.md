## Call for Sponsorship - Svelte Summit

On the 26th of April we held a first virtual conference about Svelte. It was attended by over 1000 developers enthusiastic about this growing JS framework, which has been nominated as a rising star in the State of JS 2019. Now we're organising a follow-up conference called Svelte Summit. This event will be organised online on October 18, 2020.

To organise a professional event, and to support Svelte in general, we are looking for sponsors for our event. We have 2 sponsor categories: Gold and Silver.

### Gold sponsorship (max. 3)

The gold sponsorship costs €XXX and will give your organisation the following:

* Mention as a sponsor on our event website with prominent logo placement (first 3 logos)
* Logo in banner in between talks
* Mention by host

### Silver sponsorship (max. 5)

The silver sponsorship costs €XXX and will give your organisation the following:

* Mention as a sponsor on our event website
* Mention by host

### Why sponsor?

* Support a framework loved by thousands of developers
* Help with Svelte's big-name problem: some people are on the fence about Svelte because it is not used by bigger names. But we've heard about Svelte being used by Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Let's prove the naysayers wrong.

### What will the funds be used for? (Stated goals)

* Software/services to help us host the event
    * We held the first event on YouTube, which was free. Funds will enable us to consider paid platforms such as Hopin.
* Transcriptions of talks
    * This helps to make the work of our speakers more accessible to a wider audience
* Video editing
    * Make it more professional
* Support the future of Svelte - help with hosting costs (Svelte site and REPL hosting)
* Future conferences
    * Have savings for future, possible real-life conferences
* Advertising for events
    * Increase the popularity of Svelte
