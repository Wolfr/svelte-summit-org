## Svelte Summit - Spring Edition

### Briefing for video editor

A 3rd Svelte Society virtual conference will be organized in spring 2021.

We will need a video editor to piece together the talks.

The talks will de delivered by the speakers in a format we specify.

We will recommend speakers to output a 1080p file.

#### Art/assets

* Still assets with talk details from Sessionize will be delivered by designer
* These can be composited in between talks

#### Animations needed

* A countdown timer
    * We could use a stock timer or use a timer we make ourselves

#### Tech

* We will use YouTube Premiere like the last two times to stream the conference
* StreamYard will be used for...?

#### Audio

* Please equalize the talks as much as possible, the last conference we had some problems with audio volume changes between the talks
